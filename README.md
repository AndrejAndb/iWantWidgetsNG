!!SPECIAL EDITION ONLY!!

This mod is native rework of mod iWant Widgets from DaemonPrime. 

This mods makes use of native functions for handling flash object, to speed up all operations. This basically means that the mod will be faster, but also safer, as it can now directly read return value of invoken functions (which is not possible with UI.Invoke papyrus functions). 

This mod was build using CommonLibsSE NG (template: https://github.com/SkyrimScripting/SKSE_Template_MultipleSourceAndHeaderFiles)

This mods requires both original IWant Widgets (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36457) and Address Library (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444)

Credits to DaemonPrime for creating the such simple and powerfull mod with infinite potential.
